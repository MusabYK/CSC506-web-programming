# Calculator

## 🎯 Project Overview

In **Week 2**, we built a fully functional **Redmi calculator clone** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. The app replicates the look and behavior of the Xiaomi/Redmi calculator found on the Redmi 10C. including:

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic and accessible structure
- **CSS3** – Responsive layout, variables, flexbox
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – calculation logic and interactivity

## ✨ Features

- Standard arithmetic (`+`, `−`, `×`, `÷`) with **BODMAS support**
- Plugins like `%`, decimal point, bracket handling, and smart operator logic
- A **scientific mode** (toggleable) with functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `ln`, `√`, `xʸ`, `π`, `e`
- Persistent expression mode — switching modes doesn’t clear the current input
- **History display** (shows the last calculation) which resets on **AC**, while **C** clears only the current input
- **Light/Dark mode toggle** functionality for added realism

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone the Week 2 folder** from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Unknownbosss/CSC506-web-programming.git
   cd CSC506-web-programming/Week2

   ```

2. Open index.html in your browser.

3. Use the calculator as you would on a any device:

- Tap digits and operators to form expressions

- Use <span style='color: #ff9500'>C</span> for deleting last entry, <span style='color: #ff9500'>AC</span> for full reset

- Use <svg style='color: #ff9500'
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
            width="24"
            height="24"
            viewBox="0 0 24 24"
            fill="none"
            stroke="currentColor"
            stroke-width="2"
            stroke-linecap="round"
            stroke-linejoin="round"
            class="lucide lucide-rotate-cw-square-icon lucide-rotate-cw-square"
          >
  <path d="M12 5H6a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v3" />
  <path d="m9 8 3-3-3-3" />
  <path
              d="M4 14v4a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h12a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V7a2 2 0 0 0-2-2h-2"
            />
  </svg> to toggle scientific mode without clearing the expression

- Toggle theme using the sun/moon button




## ✅ Core Features

1. BODMAS‑compliant calculations with real-time display update

2. Smart operator logic prevents invalid expressions and allows operator replacement

3. Scientific functions available when toggled, without resetting the current input

4. Responsive UI with Redmi-inspired design and true light/dark themes

5. History display and modes for a realistic experience


## 🧪 Try It Out!

Don't forget to try:

- Nested parentheses, e.g., (2 + 3) × (7 − 4)

- Scientific expressions like sin(30), √(9) + π

- Switching between light and dark themes

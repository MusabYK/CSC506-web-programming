# 500L Registration Form

A responsive and interactive registration form designed for 500-level university students to submit their personal details. This project was built using semantic HTML5, modern CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, with a focus on clean design, usability, and dynamic interactivity, all without relying on any backend or frameworks.



## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate frontend development mastery by creating a well-structured, user-friendly, and fully responsive web form that calculates a user's age in days based on their date of birth.




## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic and accessible structure
- **CSS3** – Responsive layout, variables, flexbox
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Age calculation logic and form interactivity



## ✨ Features

- Fully responsive form layout (mobile-first)
- Semantic structure with accessible labels
- Age in Days calculator (auto-updates as DOB is selected)
- Dynamic form summary display on submission
- Clean, modern design with focus and hover effects
- Fully externalized code (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)
- No frameworks, no inline code 


## 🧠 How It Works

1. Users enter their First Name, Second Name, Surname, ID Number, Date of Birth, and State of Origin.
2. The system calculates the user's age in days as soon as the date is selected or the "Calculate Age" button is clicked.
3. When the user clicks **Submit**, a clean summary of the filled-in data is displayed below the form (without reloading the page).

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
3. Fill the form and test interactivity

## 🚫 Limitations

- This is a frontend-only project; it does **not save data to a database**.
- Data is displayed on-screen only (no server interaction).



## 📌 Credits

This project was completed as part of an academic group assignment for 500-level students. Built with care by passionate frontend developers.
